Exploring Monty: A Scripting Language and Its Bytecode Files
Monty, akin to Python, is a scripting language compiled into Monty byte codes, featuring a unique stack structure with specialized instructions for manipulation. The primary aim is to develop an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files, facilitating seamless execution of Monty programs.

Understanding Monty Byte Code Files
Monty byte code files carry the .m extension, a common industry practice, though not mandatory. Key aspects include:

Single Instruction Per Line: Each line usually contains one instruction.
Flexible Formatting: Varying spaces before/after opcodes and arguments are allowed.
Monty byte code files can have blank lines or spaces, and extra text after mandatory arguments is disregarded during execution.
Available Operation Codes
Monty boasts various operation codes for specific tasks:

Opcode	Description
push	Pushes an element onto the stack.
pall	Prints all stack values from the top.
pint	Prints the value at the top of the stack.
pop	Removes the top stack element.
swap	Swaps the top two stack elements.
add	Adds the top two stack elements.
nop	No operation.
sub	Subtracts the top two stack elements.
div	Divides the top two stack elements.
mul	Multiplies the top two stack elements.
mod	Computes remainder of the top two stack elements.
#	Treats line as a comment if # is the first non-space character.
pchar	Prints the top stack element as ASCII value.
pstr	Prints stack elements as ASCII values until 0 or non-ASCII value.
rotl	Rotates top stack element to bottom.
rotr	Rotates bottom stack element to top.
stack	Default: sets data format as stack (LIFO).
queue	Sets data format as queue (FIFO).
Understanding Monty's operation codes is vital for effective programming, enabling leveraging its unique functionalities for efficient stack manipulation and program execution.
